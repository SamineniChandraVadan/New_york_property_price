### Problem overview
Productivity gap in the real estate industry costs the global economy $1.63 trillion a year, Global Construction sector ($25/hr) versus Global economy (($37/hr)
Here is a comparision of the annual increase in the productivity of few Industries :
  * Construction sector - 1%
  * Global economy  - 2.8%
  * Manufacturing - 3.6% 

One of the cause for the lack of productivity is : construction firms and contractors are more focused on optimizing up-front pricing to maintain margins than measuring and improving productivity. Inexperienced owners and buyers find it difficult to navigate an opaque marketplace

### Solution
Increase in market transparency â†’ Data-driven insights that helps firms offer more standardized products at lower price points
Firms can focus more on improving supply chain, engineering practices, onsite execution, automation, re-skilling the workforce, etc. which will address the productivity issue


## Data
<ins> </ins>
The data used is Newyork sales data for the years 2016 and 2017 from the government website. The data gives information about the property like : 
* Location information
* Building Class as defined for NYC
* Tax Class
* Number of residential and Commercial Units
* Total number of units
* Total and Land gross area in sft
* Year of built
* Year sold
* `Sale Price of the Property `

Two more data sets are created for standardising and eliminating the unwanted building classes

## Data Visualization
